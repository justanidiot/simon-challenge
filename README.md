# Simon Says Application

## Requirements
- Latest Node and NPM.
- Bower and Gulp installed globally.
- A modern browser.

## Getting Started
- Using a terminal, navigate to this repo's source folder.
- Make sure you are within the source folder.
- Run "npm run bootup" to automatically install all dependencies and start a dev server.
- Within the same source folder, run "gulp" to initiate our BrowserSync test server and live reloader for development.
- Run "gulp build" to build our production ready assets.

## Notes
- Ensure your Global Gulp CLI works with Gulp4. I used version 2.0.0 of Gulp CLI.
- If in case "npm run bootup" did not work, manually run "npm install" and "bower install".
